Wovyn data is maintained in Google sheets (belonging to Bruce)

TODO: these should be moved to the picolabsbyu account

As the end of a month approaches, a new sheet needs to be prepared

1. Copy the first tab ("day") of the current month to a new sheet
1. Visit the new sheet and give it the correct name for the new month
1. Open Tools/Script Editor on the current month
1. Select All and copy the script
1. Open Tools/Script Editor on the new month and name the project
1. Select All and paste the script
1. Use File/Save to save the script (not sure where it's saved to, but seems to be necessary)
1. Open Publish/Deploy as web app... 
1. Set Who has access to the app to be Anyone, even anonymous
1. Click on Deploy and Review permissions
1. Select the Google account and Allow all access
1. Select all and copy the Current web app URL
1. Open the Wovyn Pico and its Testing tab
1. For the `wovyn_probe_temp_recorder` rid, enter yyyy-mm and paste in the URL
1. Click the button "probe_temp_recorder/new_month_url"

Everything is now in readiness for the new month, and the first reading of that month will go into the new sheet

Created a new sheet for December 2020 in the picolabsbyu account and shared [the Wovyn folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UO_bCpsOp7Lqnn8ruhHST4kHj2yPri4l?usp=sharing) containing it
