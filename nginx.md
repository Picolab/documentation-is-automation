# Using `nginx`

## Installation
I followed the instructions for ubuntu in [this page](http://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html)

The last step seems to be stuck at 
```
Processing triggers for systemd (245.4-4ubuntu3.11) ...
```

Waiting... while looking up this message, the process finished, so I am assuming `nginx` is now installed.

## Getting started
Following instructions on [this page](http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html)
